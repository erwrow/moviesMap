# moviesMap
This is a simple site where it shows the location where movies were filmed
There are two implementations, one with a <a href="https://erwrow.github.io/moviesMap/indexCustom.html">custom DataList</a> and another one with the <a href="https://erwrow.github.io/moviesMap/indexRegular.html">regular DataList</a>, the idea was to have two approaches to the same problem.
